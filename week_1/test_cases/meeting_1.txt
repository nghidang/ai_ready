Transcript:
Sarah Johnson (10:00 AM): Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today’s meeting to discuss the launch plan for our new eco-friendly water bottle. Let’s start with a quick agenda overview: product development update, marketing strategy, operations timeline, and budget review. Any additions to the agenda?
All: (No additions)
Sarah Johnson (10:02 AM): Great, let’s begin with Emily for the product development update.
Emily Davis (10:03 AM): Thanks, Sarah. The final prototype is complete, and we’ve passed all quality tests. We’re ready to start production once operations confirms capacity. One note: we’ve sourced 90% sustainable materials, but the cap supplier is delayed by a week.
Raj Patel (10:05 AM): That’s manageable. Operations can start production by October 20th, assuming the caps arrive by then. We’ve secured two manufacturing partners, and both are prepped for a 10,000-unit initial run.
Sarah Johnson (10:07 AM): Thanks, Raj. Can you confirm the delivery timeline for retailers?
Raj Patel (10:08 AM): Yes, we’re targeting delivery to major retailers by November 15th, with smaller distributors by November 20th.
Sarah Johnson (10:09 AM): Perfect. Mark, what’s the marketing plan looking like?
Mark Chen (10:10 AM): We’ve finalized the campaign. It includes social media ads on Instagram and TikTok, a launch event on December 1st, and influencer partnerships. Budget is $50,000 for Q4. We’re also planning a pre-order page to go live November 1st. Feedback?
Lisa Wong (10:13 AM): The budget looks tight but doable. I’ve reviewed the numbers, and we’re allocating $200,000 total for the launch, including production and marketing. We need to keep marketing under $60,000 to stay on track. Can you work with that, Mark?
Mark Chen (10:15 AM): I’ll review and see where we can optimize, maybe shift some ad spend to organic content. I’ll follow up by tomorrow.
Sarah Johnson (10:17 AM): Thanks, Mark. Any risks or blockers anyone wants to flag?
Emily Davis (10:18 AM): Just the cap supplier delay. I’ll monitor it and update everyone if it impacts production.
Raj Patel (10:19 AM): From operations, we’re good as long as the supplier hits the revised timeline.
Sarah Johnson (10:20 AM): Okay, sounds like we’re aligned. Action items: Emily, keep us posted on the supplier. Mark, confirm the revised marketing budget by tomorrow. Raj, prepare a backup plan for production in case of delays. Lisa, please share the final budget breakdown by next meeting. Any other business?
All: (No additional business)
Sarah Johnson (10:22 AM): Great. Let’s wrap up early. Next meeting is October 18th at 10:00 AM. Thanks, everyone!
